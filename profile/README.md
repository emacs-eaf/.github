The Emacs Application Framework (EAF) is a powerful extension framework for Emacs. It integrates technologies such as Elisp, Python, JavaScript, Qt, and browsers, and has developed many multi-threaded graphical applications. 

Through the interaction of Emacs Lisp and Python, EAF allows Emacs to perform more complex tasks, such as web browsing, PDF reading, video playback, Git management, and web maps. 

Most importantly, EAF is designed to allow Emacs users to enjoy the convenience of modern graphical user interfaces without leaving Emacs, making Emacs a more powerful and user-friendly text editor.
